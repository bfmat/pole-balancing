\section{Introduction}

One of the most famous problems in control theory is the \textit{pole balancing problem}, also known as \textit{cart pole}. The basic idea of the problem is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A movable cart sits on a straight, finite-length track.
    \item A pole (light, relative to the cart) is anchored to the cart with a hinge.
    \item A motor is attached to the cart; it can accelerate the cart to the left or right.
    \item The goal is to prevent the pole from falling over, while also keeping the cart near the center of the track.
\end{itemize}
