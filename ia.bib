  abstract="The subject of this chapter is the motion control problem of wheeled mobile robots (WMRs). With reference to the unicycle kinematics, we review and compare several control strategies for trajectory tracking and posture stabilization in an environment free of obstacles. Experiments are reported for SuperMARIO, a two-wheel differentially-driven mobile robot. From the comparison of the obtained results, guidelines are provided for WMR end-users.",
